# ADR: Data Model Strategy – Database per Service
## Context
The AML library management system has adopted a microservices architecture to enhance scalability, flexibility, and service autonomy. Each microservice is designed to handle a specific bounded context and has distinct data storage and processing requirements. To fully leverage the benefits of microservices, the system's data model strategy must align with the principle of service independence and support for scalability, flexibility, and resilience.

## Problem Statement
The data model strategy must support the Database per Service pattern to ensure that each microservice can independently manage its data. This approach should eliminate inter-service data dependencies, provide scalability for varying data types and volumes, and enable schema evolution without impacting other services. Additionally, the strategy must address operational complexity and ensure consistent communication across services.

## Considered Options

1. **Single Database for All Microservices**: All services share a single database, using a relational model.
2. **Database per service** (Selected)

## Chosen Approach: Separate Databases for Each Microservice

We’ve chosen to implement Separate Databases for Each Microservice. Each service will have its own MongoDB database instance, enabling greater flexibility in data modeling and independent scaling.

## Consequences

### Benefits

- **Service Autonomy**: Each service controls its database, allowing for better configurations and isolated data management.
- **Enhanced Scalability**: Databases scale independently based on each service's needs.
- **Schema Flexibility**: MongoDB's schema-less model allows each service to evolve its schema independently.
- **Reduced Risk of Cross-Service Failures**: Independent databases prevent issues in one service from affecting others.

### Trade-offs

- **Increased Operational Overhead**: Managing multiple databases requires advanced monitoring and maintenance.
- **Data Consistency Challenges**: Ensuring consistency across services can be challenging without a centralized database.
- **Higher Maintenance Costs**: Each database must be individually maintained, potentially increasing administrative overhead.

## Pros of Separate Databases per Microservice

- **Independence**: Each service operates with its own database, making it easier to develop and deploy.
- **Optimized Data Models**: Services can tailor their data models and indexes to their specific needs.
- **Flexibility in Schema Management**: MongoDB's flexible schema allows rapid changes without impacting other services.

## Cons of Separate Databases per Microservice

- **Operational Complexity**: Managing multiple databases requires more tools and effort.
- **Data Redundancy**: Some data duplication may occur between services.
- **Cross-Service Transactions**: Multi-service transactions can be harder to manage.

## Confirmations

The decision to use separate MongoDB databases per microservice supports AML’s goal of a highly scalable, flexible, and autonomous microservices architecture. This model is well-suited for the AML system’s data requirements and allows each service to operate independently, ensuring future growth and system reliability.

## Pros and Cons of Other Considered Options

### Single Database for All Microservices

   **Pros**:  
   - Simplified management with one centralized database.
   - Easier to maintain cross-service consistency.
   
   **Cons**:  
   - Limits scalability as all services share a single database resource.
   - High risk of cascading failures and performance bottlenecks.
   - Less flexible for services with unique data requirements.

## Conclusion
The Database per Service pattern aligns with the goals of AML’s microservices architecture by enabling service independence, scalability, and flexibility. While it introduces some operational challenges, these are outweighed by the benefits of autonomous data management and the ability to grow and evolve the system seamlessly. This decision ensures the AML system is robust, scalable, and prepared for future enhancements.
