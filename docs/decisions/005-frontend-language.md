# ADR: Frontend Language Selection

## Context
Selecting a frontend language for the new AML system to deliver an interactive and responsive user interface.

## Problem Statement
The library management system requires a frontend framework that allows dynamic, component-based development with strong server-side rendering (SSR) capabilities for SEO. The chosen framework should be efficient, support microservices integration, and be well-suited to handle both current needs and future expansions in functionality.

## Considered Options
-Next.js
-React
-Vue.js  

## Decision Outcome Confirmation
After careful consideration, Next.js has been selected as the frontend framework for the AML system. Next.js builds on React, providing additional capabilities such as server-side rendering, static site generation, and built-in routing. These features enhance performance, improve SEO, and align well with the scalability and modularity needs of our microservices-based system.

## Consequences
With Next.js, we gain the benefits of React's component-based development while also leveraging SSR and static generation for SEO and performance gains. Its ability to handle API routes and code-splitting aligns with our requirements for a scalable, efficient, and responsive frontend solution. The large Next.js ecosystem and active community will also support future feature expansions.

## Pros
- Component-Based with React: Built on React, Next.js enables modular and reusable components, simplifying updates and maintenance.
-API Routes and Routing: Simplifies data fetching and backend integration, supporting our microservices-based architecture.
-Automatic Code Splitting: Loads only the code necessary for each page, improving user experience with faster page loads.
-Robust Community and Ecosystem: With extensive resources, Next.js provides numerous plugins, libraries, and community support.

## Cons
-Learning Curve for SSR and SSG: Developers may need to learn about SSR and static generation, adding complexity compared to client-side-only frameworks.
-Reliance on the React Ecosystem: Familiarity with React’s concepts, such as state management, is necessary.
-Increased Server Costs: SSR may incur higher server costs compared to client-side-only frameworks, though static generation can mitigate this.

## Confirmations
We have confirmed Next.js as the best choice for the AML system frontend due to its combination of React’s component-based architecture and Next.js’s SEO and performance advantages. This decision provides a flexible, scalable, and high-performing frontend that aligns well with both current and future needs.

## Pros and Cons of Options

### React.js(without Next.js)

**Pros**:  
- Component-Based Architecture: Modular, reusable components simplify maintenance and allow efficient development.
- Large Community and Ecosystem: Extensive resources, libraries, and support are available, as React is widely used.
- Fast Client-Side Rendering: Excellent for SPAs with a smooth, interactive experience.
  
**Cons**:  
- Lacks Native SSR/SEO Support: While React is fast for SPAs, it doesn’t inherently support server-side rendering or static generation, making SEO optimization more challenging.
- Requires Additional Setup for Routing and SSR: For SSR, you would need additional setup or integration with frameworks like Next.js or Gatsby.
- SEO Limitations for Large-Scale Apps: SEO-focused projects may require more setup or plugins to make React fully SEO-compatible.
  
### Vue.js  

**Pros**:  
- Lightweight and Flexible: Vue.js is straightforward, with a flexible structure for small to medium-sized applications.
- Reactive Data Binding: The two-way data binding and component-based architecture streamline development.
- Good Performance for Smaller Applications: Vue's lightweight nature makes it well-suited for smaller or mid-sized applications. 

**Cons**:  
- Limited SSR and SEO Features: While Vue can integrate SSR with Nuxt.js, it requires additional setup.
- Smaller Community Compared to React: Fewer resources and libraries, especially for enterprise-grade applications.
- Less Ideal for Complex or Large-Scale Projects: Vue has a smaller ecosystem and is less commonly used for highly complex, large-scale applications.
