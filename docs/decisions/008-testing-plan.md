# ADR - Testing Plan

## Context 
The advanced library management system uses a microservices architecture with Next.js, Express.js, and MongoDB to manage borrowing, returning, and wishlist features. A comprehensive testing strategy is essential to ensure the functionality, reliability, and security of the system. 

## Problem Statement
Without a well-defined testing plan, the advanced library management system could face challenges such as undetected bugs and integration problems. These challenges may impact key functionalities, including borrowing, returning, and wishlist management, as well as the overall security and scalability of the system. Therefore, implementing a structured testing strategy is crucial to ensure the system meets its functional and non-functional requirements while delivering a smooth and reliable user experience.
